# ts-pymfe
A backup for the pymfe expansion for time-series data. Currently, this repository contains the methods for meta-feature extraction and an modified pymfe core to run extract the meta-features.

There is 149 distinct metafeature extraction methods in this version, distributed in the following groups:

1. General
2. Local statistics
3. Global statistics
4. Statistical tests
5. Autocorrelation
6. Frequency domain
7. Information theory
8. Randomize
9. Landmarking
10. Model based

## Install
From pip:
``
pip install -U tspymfe
``
or:
``
python3 -m pip install -U tspymfe
``

## Usage
To extract the meta-features, the API behaves pretty much like the original Pymfe API:
```python
import pymfe.tsmfe
import numpy as np

# random time-series
ts = 0.3 * np.arange(100) + np.random.randn(100)

extractor = pymfe.tsmfe.TSMFE()
extractor.fit(ts)
res = extractor.extract()

print(res)
```

## Dev-install
If you downloaded directly from github, install the required packages using:
```
pip install -Ur requirements.txt
```

You can run some test scripts:
```
python test_a.py <data_id> <random_seed> <precomp 0/1>
python test_b.py <data_id> <random_seed> <precomp 0/1>
```
Where the first argument is the test time-series id (check [data/comp-engine-export-sample.20200503.csv](https://github.com/FelSiq/ts-pymfe/tree/master/data) file.) and must be between 0 (inclusive) and 19 (also inclusive), the random seed must be an integer, and precomp is a boolean argument ('0' or '1') to activate the precomputation methods, used to calculate common values between various methods and, therefore, speed the main computations.

Example:
```
python test_a.py 0 16 1
python test_b.py 0 16 1
```

The code format style is checked using flake8, pylint and mypy. You can use the Makefile to run all verifications by yourself:
```
pip install -Ur requirements-dev.txt
make code-check
```
